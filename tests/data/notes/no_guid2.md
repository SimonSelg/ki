<p>Notes about this deck:
<p><b>• In the back of the card, there is a gray button below the
answer. Tap this button to open a dictionary-lookup menu.</b>
<p><b>• If some sentence is too easy for you, or repeated, or it
teaches you nothing new... then delete that sentence!</b> In the
Computer version of Anki, you can delete the card by pressing
<i>Delete</i> on your keyboard. You should delete cards that are
too easy for you, or cards that teach you nothing new... otherwise
the card-reviews will pile up to a big number.
<p>• Speak training is a lot harder than read training, but it's
also more productive: it increases fluency more.
<p>• The sentences of the <i>read training</i> deck are sorted in a
way, that they start out with very simple vocabulary. They are
repetitive on purpose, to reinforce beginner vocabulary. • On the
other hand, the sentences of the <i>speak training</i> deck are a
lot more varied. They have a lot more variety.
<p>• This deck contains <i>idiomatic sentences</i>. You may think
the translation is wrong, but it's right. If you don't know what is
an idiomatic sentence, see: <a href= 
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom</a>
<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_idioms">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_idioms</a>
For example, when you say <i>it's raining cats and dogs</i>, you
don't mean that literally. You mean that it's raining heavily.
Thus, <i>it's raining cats and dogs</i> is an <i>idiomatic
sentence</i>.
<p>• You don't have to memorize <i>everything</i> in the back of
the card. Focus on getting the <i>overall answer</i> right. For
example, if there are 4 sentences on the back of the card... focus
on getting just the first sentence right.
<p>• This deck works better on the Computer version of Anki.
<p>• If you are using the Computer version of Anki, I highly
recommend the add-on called Speed Focus Mode: <a href= 
"https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1046608507">https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1046608507</a>
The first version of this add-on was commissioned by me, then it
became a very popular add-on.

<b>Q&A</b>
<p><b>— What is the point of studying sentences?</b>
<p>Memorizing the meaning of individual words... is pretty much
pointless. If you want actual fluency, you need to see a word in as
many example sentences as possible. That makes the language start
to flow in your head. That shows you how to use the word. How it is
combined with the other words. And many other things.
<p>We think that <i>effort</i> always converts into <i>fluency</i>.
This is not true. If you memorize the meaning of individual words
you won't get fluent and you will spend a ton of effort. But
studying sentences is the real deal. Is the method of learning that
actually converts effort to fluency.
<p>Get some basic grammar, some basic vocabulary, then just dive
into sentences and more sentences until you're fluent.
<p>~
<p>It is OK to memorize individual words if: • You don't have
enough vocabulary to focus your study on sentences, or • You are a
very advanced learner Otherwise, it is better to just focus on
learning and memorizing sentences — instead of memorizing
individual words.
<p>~
<p>Some words are simple and straightforward: • Tsuki means
<i>moon</i> in Japanese, and nothing more. • Playa means
<i>beach</i> in Spanish, and nothing more. • Montano means
<i>mountain</i> in Italian, and nothing more. These words are easy:
you memorize the meaning, you master the word.
<p>Other words are complex: • The French word <i>faire</i> can mean
10 different things, depending on context. <a href= 
"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/faire#French">[source]</a> • The
German word <i>machen</i> can mean 20 different things, depending
on context. <a href=
"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/machen#German">[source]</a> • The
English word <i>make</i> can mean 30 different things, depending on
context. <a href=
"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/make#English">[source]</a> You will
only master these words, when you see them in context! You will
only master these words, when you see them in example sentences.
<p>Hence the need to study sentences.
<p><b>— If this deck has so many cards, won't it take me a long
time to finish it?</b> If you study one card every 7 seconds, then
you can study 500 cards per hour. It's quicker than you think.
<p><b>— How much should I study?</b> Try to study at least 20
minutes a day — or do 50 cards a day. You will see visible results.
<p><b>— I'm having technical issues.</b> If you have technical
issues, search your issue on Google (for example: <i>audio doesn't
work on Anki using MacOS</i>) and see if you can find a solution to
your problem. And if Google fails you, ask the developer of Anki:
<a href=
"https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/help.html">https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/help.html</a>
— he usually replies within 24h. I should mention, that I have no
affiliation with the developer of Anki.
