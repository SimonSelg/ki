Python package `ki` is a command-line interface for the version control and
editing of ``.anki2`` collections as git repositories of markdown files.
Rather than providing an interactive UI like the Anki desktop client, `ki` aims
to allow natural editing *in the filesystem*.

In general, the purpose of `ki` is to allow users to work on large, complex
Anki decks in exactly the same way they work on large, complex software
projects.

TODO
----
- Add implementations to test function sigs in `tests/test_ki.py`. (DONE)
- Add `shell-doctest` tests for CLI subcommands.
- Add implementations of `clone`, `pull`, and `push`. (DONE)
- Make sure `push` acquires lock on SQLite3 file before overwriting.
- Make clone work on empty directories to match `git` behavior.
- Test utilities.


Notes
-----
To debug gitpython commands:
    export GIT_PYTHON_TRACE=full
