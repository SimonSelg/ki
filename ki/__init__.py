"""
Python package `ki` is a command-line interface for the version control and
editing of ``.anki2`` collections as git repositories of markdown files.
Rather than providing an interactive UI like the Anki desktop client, `ki` aims
to allow natural editing *in the filesystem*.

In general, the purpose of `ki` is to allow users to work on large, complex
Anki decks in exactly the same way they work on large, complex software
projects.
